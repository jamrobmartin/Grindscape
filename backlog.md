# Grindscape Backlog
This isnt a true backlog. Its more like a running list of aspects of the game that I need to, or have, implemented.

# Server Side:
## Server Setup:

 [ ]Create a server application using C#.\
 [ ]Set up a TCP listener to accept incoming client connections.\
## Client Management:

 [ ]Implement a data structure (e.g., list) to manage connected clients.\
 [ ]Handle client connections and disconnections.\
## Database Integration:

 [ ]Choose and set up a database system (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite).\
 [ ]Establish a database connection.\
 [ ]Create database tables to store game data (e.g., user accounts, game progress).\
## User Authentication:

 [ ]Implement a user authentication system.\
 [ ]Create a database schema for user accounts.\
 [ ]Implement user registration functionality.\
 [ ]Implement user login and logout functionality.\
 [ ]Validate user credentials against the database.\
## Game Logic:

 [ ]Develop the core game logic and rules.\
 [ ]Implement basic game functionality (e.g., player movement, actions).\
## Synchronization:

 [ ]Implement synchronization mechanisms to ensure game state consistency among clients.\
 [ ]Implement a messaging system for real-time communication between clients and the server.\
## Persistence:

 [ ]Save and load game data to/from the database (e.g., player progress, game state).\
 [ ]Implement data persistence mechanisms to store and retrieve game data.\
# Client Side:
## Client Setup:

 [ ]Create a client application using C#.\
 [ ]Implement client-side networking to connect to the server.\
## User Interface (UI):

 [ ]Design and develop the game's user interface (UI).\
 [ ]Create UI components (e.g., menus, HUD).\
 [ ]Implement UI interactions and navigation.\
## User Authentication:

 [ ]Develop the user registration and login screens.\
 [ ]Implement user registration and login functionality.\
 [ ]Handle user authentication errors and feedback.\
## Game Rendering:

 [ ]Implement the game's rendering engine.\
 [ ]Display game graphics and assets.\
 [ ]Handle rendering game elements (e.g., characters, objects, environments).\
## Gameplay:

 [ ]Implement player controls and interactions.\
 [ ]Sync with the server to receive game state updates.\
 [ ]Handle user input for player actions.\
## Networking:

 [ ]Set up client-side networking to establish a connection to the server.\
 [ ]Implement communication protocols for sending and receiving game data.\
## Game Logic:

 [ ]Implement client-side game logic to interpret and process game data.\
 [ ]Handle game events and state transitions.\
## Persistence:

 [ ]Implement local data storage to save and load user preferences and settings.\
## Error Handling and Feedback:

 [ ]Implement error handling mechanisms.\
 [ ]Provide user feedback for various game interactions and errors.\
## Testing and Debugging:

 [ ]Perform thorough testing of the client application.\
 [ ]Debug and fix any issues or glitches.\
## Deployment:

 [ ]Prepare the client application for distribution and deployment.\
